Youth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure

over the love of ease. This often exits in a man of 60, more than a boy of 20.nobody grows merely by

the number of years; we grow old by deserting our ideas. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up

enthusiasm wrinkles the soul. Worry, fear, self-distrust bows the heart and turns the spirit back to

dust.
